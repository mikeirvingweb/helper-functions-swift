# Helper Functions for Swift
Common functionality I use in Swift to help me with common data and environment issues.

As I work in multiple languages, *regularly*, I often write snippets of code to provide functionality *similar* to I'm used to in the other languages.

### Files
I have tried to divide the functions up by usage type:

*DateFunctions.swift* ðŸ“…

*ImageFunctions.swift* ðŸ–¼

*StringFunctions.swift* ðŸ§µ

*UIFunctions.swift* ðŸ§±

#### Feel free to add or amend
I expect to add to these functions over time, and functions may get moved between files, or placed into new files, as appropriate.
